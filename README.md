# Scalable Cross-Filtering Dashboars with Panel, HoloViews and hvPlot

Introducing automatic linked selection and cross filtering tools for [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org), [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org), and [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) supporting the concise and convenient `.plot()` interface in Pandas or Xarray along with custom widgets from [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org), allowing data scientists to create even complex dashboards relating values across each of the dimensions without having to program with callbacks or other advanced mechanisms.
